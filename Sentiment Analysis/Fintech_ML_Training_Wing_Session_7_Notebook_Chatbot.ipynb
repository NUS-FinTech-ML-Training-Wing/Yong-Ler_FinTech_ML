    "\n",
    "    The main issue with text data is that it is all in text format (strings). However, Machine learning algorithms need some sort of numerical feature vector in order to perform the task. So before we start with any NLP project we need to pre-process it to make it ideal for work. Basic text pre-processing includes:\n",
    "1. Converting the entire text into uppercase or lowercase, so that the algorithm does not treat the same words in different cases as different\n",
    "2. Tokenization: Tokenization is just the term used to describe the process of converting the normal text strings into a list of tokens i.e words that we actually want. Sentence tokenizer can be used to find the list of sentences and Word tokenizer can be used to find the list of words in strings. The NLTK data package includes a pre-trained Punkt tokenizer for English.\n",
    "3. Removing Noise i.e everything that isn’t in a standard number or letter.\n",
    "4. Removing Stop words. Sometimes, some extremely common words which would appear to be of little value in helping select documents matching a user need are excluded from the vocabulary entirely. These words are called stop words\n",
    "5. Stemming: Stemming is the process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their stem, base or root form — generally a written word form. Example if we were to stem the following words: “Stems”, “Stemming”, “Stemmed”, “and Stemtization”, the result would be a single word “stem”.\n",
    "6. Lemmatization: A slight variant of stemming is lemmatization. The major difference between these is, that, stemming can often create non-existent words, whereas lemmas are actual words. So, your root stem, meaning the word you end up with, is not something you can just look up in a dictionary, but you can look up a lemma. Examples of Lemmatization are that “run” is a base form for words like “running” or “ran” or that the word “better” and “good” are in the same lemma so they are considered the same.\n",

    "After the initial preprocessing phase, we need to transform text into a meaningful vector (or array) of numbers. The bag-of-words is a representation of text that describes the occurrence of words within a document. It involves two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A vocabulary of known words.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A measure of the presence of known words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it is called a “bag” of words? That is because any information about the order or structure of words in the document is discarded and the model is only **concerned with whether the known words occur in the document, not where they occur in the document.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind the Bag of Words is that documents are similar if they have similar content. Also, we can learn something about the meaning of the document from its content alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if our dictionary contains the words {Learning, is, the, not, great}, and we want to vectorize the text “Learning is great”, we would have the following vector: (1, 1, 0, 0, 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s make the bag-of-words model concrete with a worked example.\n",

    "it was the age of wisdom,\n",
    "it was the age of foolishness,\n",
    "\n",
    "For this small example, let’s treat each line as a separate “document” and the 4 lines as our entire corpus of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Design the Vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can make a list of all of the words in our model vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unique words here (ignoring case and punctuation) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "“it”\n",
    "“was”\n",
    "“the”\n",
    "“best”\n",
    "“of”\n",
    "“times”\n",
    "“worst”\n",
    "“age”\n",
    "“wisdom”\n",
    "“foolishness”\n",
    "That is a vocabulary of 10 words from a corpus containing 24 words.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Create Document Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to score the words in each document.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to turn each document of free text into a vector that we can use as input or output for a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we know the vocabulary has 10 words, we can use a fixed-length document representation of 10, with one position in the vector to score each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest scoring method is to mark the presence of words as a boolean value, 0 for absent, 1 for present.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the arbitrary ordering of words listed above in our vocabulary, we can step through the first document (“It was the best of times“) and convert it into a binary vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scoring of the document would look as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "“it” = 1\n",
    "“was” = 1\n",
    "“the” = 1\n",
    "“best” = 1\n",
    "“of” = 1\n",
    "“times” = 1\n",
    "“worst” = 0\n",
    "“age” = 0\n",
    "“wisdom” = 0\n",
    "“foolishness” = 0\n",
    "As a binary vector, this would look as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1\n",
    "[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "The other three documents would look as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "\"it was the worst of times\" = [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "\"it was the age of wisdom\" = [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n",
    "\"it was the age of foolishness\" = [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n",
    "All ordering of the words is nominally discarded and we have a consistent way of extracting features from any document in our corpus, ready for use in modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "New documents that overlap with the vocabulary of known words, but may contain words outside of the vocabulary, can still be encoded, where only the occurrence of known words are scored and unknown words are ignored.\n",
